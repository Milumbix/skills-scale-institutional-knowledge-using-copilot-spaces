# OctoAcme Project Management Process Docs

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management process documentation. These documents provide a comprehensive guide to how OctoAcme plans, executes, and delivers projects.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a **customer-centric and iterative** project management approach that emphasizes:

- **Customer-first delivery**: Prioritizing customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative increments**: Delivering small, testable features frequently
- **Clear roles and ownership**: Defined responsibilities for Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders
- **Lifecycle stages**: Structured phases from Initiation through Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective
- **Risk management**: Proactive identification and mitigation of risks throughout the project
- **Communication cadence**: Regular syncs, standups, and stakeholder updates to maintain alignment
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measuring impact and iterating based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encouraging feedback and continuous learning
