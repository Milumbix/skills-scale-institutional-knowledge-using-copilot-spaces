# Change Adoption Checklist

This checklist provides a structured approach for Change Champions to drive successful adoption of new processes, tools, or features across the organization.

---

## Purpose

This checklist helps Change Champions:
- Assess organizational readiness for change initiatives
- Plan comprehensive communications and training programs
- Track adoption metrics and identify barriers
- Define clear go/no-go criteria for change rollouts
- Gather and act on user feedback to improve adoption

---

## Readiness Assessment

Complete this assessment 4-6 weeks before planned change rollout:

### 1. Change Impact Analysis
- [ ] Identify all user groups affected by the change
- [ ] Assess magnitude of change (minor tweak vs. major workflow shift)
- [ ] Determine number of users impacted (10 users vs. 1000 users)
- [ ] Evaluate current process maturity (replacing chaos vs. replacing working system)
- [ ] Identify key stakeholders who must support the change
- [ ] Document benefits and value proposition for each user group

### 2. Organizational Readiness
- [ ] Assess change fatigue (how many recent changes have users experienced?)
- [ ] Evaluate leadership support and commitment
- [ ] Determine resource availability (trainers, support staff, budget)
- [ ] Review cultural factors (openness to change, past change success rate)
- [ ] Identify change champions in each affected team
- [ ] Assess technical readiness (infrastructure, tools, integrations)

### 3. Risk & Resistance Assessment
- [ ] Identify potential sources of resistance (comfort with status quo, skill gaps, competing priorities)
- [ ] Assess risk of adoption failure and impact if change doesn't take hold
- [ ] Determine mitigation strategies for anticipated resistance
- [ ] Plan for rollback or phased approach if needed
- [ ] Identify early adopters who can model desired behavior

### 4. Readiness Score

Rate each dimension 1-5 (1=not ready, 5=highly ready):

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Leadership support | [1-5] | [Comments] |
| User need/pain point | [1-5] | [Comments] |
| Resource availability | [1-5] | [Comments] |
| Technical readiness | [1-5] | [Comments] |
| Change capacity | [1-5] | [Comments] |
| **Overall Readiness** | [Avg] | **>4.0 = Green, 3.0-4.0 = Yellow, <3.0 = Red** |

**Recommendation**: 
- **Green**: Proceed with rollout as planned
- **Yellow**: Address gaps before proceeding or plan phased rollout
- **Red**: Delay rollout until readiness improves

---

## Training Plan

Develop comprehensive training to ensure users can successfully adopt the change:

### Training Needs Analysis
- [ ] Identify knowledge gaps between current state and desired state
- [ ] Determine skill levels of different user groups
- [ ] Assess preferred learning styles (hands-on, video, documentation)
- [ ] Identify users who need basic vs. advanced training
- [ ] Determine if just-in-time training or advance training is better

### Training Materials Development

Create training assets:
- [ ] **Quick start guide** (1-page cheat sheet for basic use)
- [ ] **Detailed user documentation** (comprehensive how-to guide)
- [ ] **Video tutorials** (5-10 min demos for key workflows)
- [ ] **FAQs** (anticipated questions and answers)
- [ ] **Practice environment** (sandbox for hands-on learning)
- [ ] **Use case examples** (real-world scenarios relevant to users)

### Training Delivery Plan

| User Group | Training Format | Duration | Schedule | Trainer | Attendance Target |
|------------|----------------|----------|----------|---------|------------------|
| [Group] | [Live session / Self-paced / Office hours] | [Time] | [Date] | [Name] | [%] |

### Training Checklist
- [ ] Training materials completed 2 weeks before rollout

## Adoption Metrics

Define and track metrics to measure adoption success:

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | How to Measure | Frequency |
|--------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Training completion rate | ≥ 80% | LMS or attendance tracking | Weekly |
| Active users | ≥ 70% within 30 days | Usage analytics | Daily |
| Feature adoption rate | ≥ 60% key features used | Analytics / telemetry | Weekly |
| User satisfaction | ≥ 4/5 | Post-adoption survey | 30 days post-launch |
| Support ticket volume | Decreasing trend | Support system | Daily |
| Time to proficiency | < 2 weeks avg | User surveys | 30 days post-launch |

### Leading Indicators (Early Warning Signs)

Monitor these to identify adoption issues early:
- [ ] Low training registration rate (< 50% by 1 week before launch)
- [ ] High volume of negative feedback or concerns
- [ ] Low engagement with pre-launch communications
- [ ] Key influencers or leaders not bought in
- [ ] Technical issues blocking access or use

### Lagging Indicators (Outcome Measures)

Track these to assess overall adoption success:
- [ ] % of users actively using the new tool/process
- [ ] % of users who have stopped using the old method
- [ ] Productivity metrics (time saved, errors reduced)
- [ ] Business outcomes achieved (costs reduced, quality improved)
- [ ] User satisfaction and NPS scores

### Dashboard

Create a simple adoption dashboard:

```
Change Adoption Dashboard - [Change Name]
Last Updated: [Date]

Training:        [X%] ██████████░░░░ (Target: 80%)
Active Users:    [X%] ████████░░░░░░ (Target: 70%)
User Sat (1-5):  [X.X] ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (Target: 4.0)
Support Tickets: [X] (Trend: ↓ / → / ↑)

Status: 🟢 On Track / 🟡 At Risk / 🔴 Off Track
```
