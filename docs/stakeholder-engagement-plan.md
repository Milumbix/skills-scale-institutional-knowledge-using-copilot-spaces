## Purpose

The stakeholder engagement plan ensures:
- All relevant stakeholders are identified and mapped
- Communication is tailored to stakeholder needs and preferences
- Feedback loops are established and maintained
- Decision-making and approval processes are clear
- Expectations are managed proactively

## Stakeholder Identification & Mapping

### Stakeholder Matrix

Use this template to document all project stakeholders:

| Stakeholder Name | Role/Department | Influence Level | Interest Level | Communication Frequency | Preferred Channel | Key Concerns | Engagement Strategy |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| [Name] | [Job title/team] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | Weekly/Bi-weekly/Monthly/Milestone | Email/Slack/Meeting | [List concerns] | [How to engage] |

**Influence Level**:
- **High**: Decision-maker, budget owner, executive sponsor, can block/approve project
- **Medium**: Input provider, subject matter expert, affected by outcomes
- **Low**: Informed party, peripheral interest

**Interest Level**:
- **High**: Directly affected, invested in outcomes, actively engaged
- **Medium**: Indirectly affected, occasional engagement needed
- **Low**: Minimal impact, awareness only

### Stakeholder Quadrants

Plot stakeholders to determine engagement approach:

- **High Influence + High Interest**: **Manage Closely** - Regular 1:1s, involve in decisions, frequent updates
- **High Influence + Low Interest**: **Keep Satisfied** - Concise updates, escalate only critical issues
- **Low Influence + High Interest**: **Keep Informed** - Regular updates, open feedback channels
- **Low Influence + Low Interest**: **Monitor** - Periodic updates, minimal engagement

## Engagement Best Practices

- **Start early**: Engage stakeholders during project initiation, not just before launch
- **Be proactive**: Share updates before stakeholders have to ask
- **Tailor communication**: Executives want summaries; ICs want details
- **Use visuals**: Dashboards, roadmaps, and demos are more engaging than text
- **Listen actively**: Stakeholder concerns often reveal hidden risks
- **Respect time**: Keep meetings focused and end early if possible
- **Document decisions**: Clear audit trail prevents revisiting settled questions
- **Celebrate wins**: Share successes and recognize contributions
